    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, toss together the chicken, yogurt, garlic, ginger, garam
            masala, cumin, turmeric, cayenne pepper, and salt. Let
            sit 5-10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and sear on both sides until browned.
            Add butter and toss to coat the chicken. Remove the chicken from the skillet
            to a plate.</li>
        <li>To the skillet, add the onion and cook until softened. Add butter, garlic,
            ginger, garam masala, cumin, turmeric,
            cayenne pepper, and the chili flakes. Season with salt and pepper. Cook until very fragrant. Add the tomato
            paste and continue cooking another 3-4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low. Add water and the coconut milk. Stir to combine, bring the sauce to a simmer,
            cook 5 minutes or until the sauce thickens slightly. Stir in butter. If the sauce seems thick,
            thin with additional coconut milk. Add the chicken and any juices on the pan and cook, stirring
            occasionally, until the sauce thickens slightly. Remove from the heat and stir in the
            cilantro. Season with salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>Serve the chicken and sauce over bowls of rice with fresh naan.</li>
